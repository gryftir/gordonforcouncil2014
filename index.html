<h1><a name="whyrun">Why Gordon wants to be your City Council Member</a></h1>
<p>Because I have 30 plus years of
local government management experience in California, and because I am
passionately committed to government in the public interest, I believe
I am <b>uniquely qualified</b> to represent you on the Morgan Hill City
Council. And because I know how a city should be run inside and out, I
can offer you <b>effective representation from day one</b>. </p><p> To <b>lead</b> in the
public interest, I need to <b>listen to you</b> to learn what you envision for
Morgan Hill and what issues are closest to your heart. Please feel free
to call me at (408) 782-8979, email me at gordon.siebert@gmail.com or
attend one of our <a href="index.html#event">events</a>. </p><p> In addition to having served both as a city
manager and as Deputy Director of Public Works in San Jose, I actually
served as Morgan Hill&#8217;s Director of Public Works AND as
Interim Finance Director in the 1990&#8217;s. I balanced our budget
during difficult economic times, and led the team which designed and
built Butterfield Blvd.</p><p> My wife, Esther, and I first moved to Morgan
Hill in 1989 and our three adult children attended Morgan Hill Schools.
We&#8217;re active in our Morgan Hill synagogue. I am a past member
of Morgan Hill Rotary and have served as a Boy Scout counselor. I have
a BS in Civil Engineering and an MS in Public Policy &amp;
Management from Carnegie-Mellon University. </p>
<h1><a name="event">Thank you for Meeting Gordon at Booksmart on Saturday August 28th at 2 pm</a></h1>
<p>Gordon was happy to talk to
everyone and to hear what you wanted for Morgan Hill. He looks forward
to more opportunities to hear from you, and to talk about why he wants
to be your City Council member.</p>
