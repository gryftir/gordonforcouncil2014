                    <h1>Who is Gordon Siebert?</h1>
                    <p><font size="+1">I grew up in a row house in
                    Pittsburgh, PA with my parents, sister and grandparents all living in a
                    small space. My parents slept in the dining room so my grandparents
                    could have their own room. Depression survivors, they taught me how to
                    live frugally and how to work hard.
                    </font></p><p><font size="+1"> After service as a Marine in WWII,
                    my Dad Albert worked most of his career managing a grocery store. My
                    Mom and Grandma stayed at home to run the house. My Mom Blanche was
                    able to volunteer and became President of her City of Hope Chapter. I observed how
                    hard my Dad worked six days a week. This gave me a strong work ethic
                    but also encouraged me to pursue higher education. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="+1"> After attending
                    public schools through high school, I attended Carnegie-Mellon
                    University, served as a member of the Student Senate, student member of
                    the University Board of Trustees, President of Alpha Phi Omega Service
                    Fraternity, and graduated with BS in Civil Engineering and later with
                    an MS in Public Policy &amp; Management.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="+1">
                    While in school, I started and ran a business publishing telephone
                    directories for universities and also managed a taxi company. My public
                    service began as a surveyor for the City of Pittsburgh. After graduate
                    school, I worked for the City of Rockville, MD as a Budget Director and
                    Community Development Manager. When I left, the City gave me an award
                    for having managed the City&rsquo;s budget as tightly as if I was
                    spending the money from my own wallet. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="+1"> My private employer moved me to
                    California in 1980, where I rose to Director of Public Works in Rancho
                    Palos Verdes and then became City Manager in Palos Verdes Estates.
                    There I learned to manage staff, balance budgets, deliver quality
                    services and work with Council.</font></p><p><font size="+1"> My family moved to Morgan Hill in 1989,
                    where I served as Director of Public Works until 1995. Among my
                    accomplishments in Morgan Hill are building the first phase of
                    Butterfield (then Sutter) Blvd., rebuilding the City&rsquo;s fire
                    hydrants, and building the waste water treatment plant in conjunction
                    with the City of Gilroy. I was also simultaneously Interim Finance
                    Director from 1990 to 1991, where I worked with the City Manager to
                    balance the budget, eliminating a projected 25% deficit. I subsequently
                    served as Director of Public Works in Daly City and Deputy Director of
                    Public Works in San Jose. Currently, I work for Monterey County. I am a
                    Registered Civil Engineer in California which allowed me to work as a
                    partner in an Engineering Consulting business to help numerous cities
                    solve problems and run more efficiently.</font></p><p><font size="+1"> My civic involvement has
                    included an appointment to the Santa Clara County Measure A/B
                    (Transportation Sales Tax) Citizens Watchdog Committee, where I also
                    served as Audit Committee Chairperson, and on the San Mateo County
                    Transportation Technical Advisory Committee. I have been a member of
                    the Morgan Hill Rotary Club, Boy Scouts and served as a Board Member of
                    Congregation Emeth. At the National level, I serve on two committees of
                    the American Public Works Association, Education and Buildings
                    &amp; Grounds. I&rsquo;ve been married for 29 years to Esther
                    and have three adult children, all of whom attended Morgan Hill public
                    schools.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="+1">
                    I like working with my hands in my spare time: gardening, restoring
                    old cars and doing my own home improvements. I also love to read; it's one of my favorite ways to relax. I
                    love living in Morgan Hill. I love the natural beauty, the
                    friendliness of the community and the small town ambience.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="+1">That&rsquo;s
                    why I&rsquo;m running. To protect our quality of life, continue to
                    improve on our destination downtown, and to bring financial security to
                    our city budget.</font> </p>
