<h2>Gordon's Positions on Issues</h2>
<h3>Gordon Siebert on Public Safety Issues in Morgan Hill</h3>
It is important to maintain our local police department. Because our
police force is integrated into the fabric of our community, the
department and its officers have the sensitivity to provide the kind of
community policing that gets the best results. However, I&rsquo;m
open to exploring contracting options, especially for specialized
services such as a bomb squad or hostage negotiator, if those services
can be integrated with our own Police Department.
<p>As a City Manager, I
oversaw the Police Department and hired a new Police Chief. It is very
important that we choose the right Police Chief for Morgan Hill and I
believe that you and I can make a contribution to that process. </p><p>
Morgan Hill is fortunate to be a safe place to live, with a crime rate
below the county&rsquo;s average. However, there are problems and
we must seek opportunities to make the city even safer. We have an
outstanding Police Department that is working under difficult financial
constraints. Their effectiveness comes from solid leadership, employee
training and being provided with the right tools. Efficiency is
achieved through smart personnel selection and the best utilization and
deployment of resources.</p><p>
We all can help support our local Police Department by volunteering,
supporting the Community Law Enforcement Foundation and participating
in the upcoming forums to guide the selection of our next Police Chief.
</p><p>
Fire safety and emergency medical care as well as traffic control are
important too. We can be good citizens by eliminating hazards such as
overgrown weeds. Emergency preparedness, an area in which Morgan Hill
excels, offers opportunities for everyone to be involved, in
one&rsquo;s own home or by participating at the community level.
Other important elements to protect public safety include street
lighting, traffic safety and the wide availability of recreational
activities.
</p>
<h4>My Public Safety Accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
<li>Worked with the Rockville, MD Police Department to secure a grant to hire more police officers</li>
<li>Attended team-building exercises with two police chiefs while serving as Palos Verdes Estates&rsquo; City Manager</li>
<li>Competed for and secured nearly a dozen traffic safety grants in cities throughout California</li>
<li>Worked with residents to raise funds to enhance police, fire and emergency medical service</li>
<li>Negotiated a contract with Los Angeles County which improved fire services and lowered costs</li>
</ul><br class="clear" /><br />
<h3>Gordon Siebert on Economic Development Issues in Morgan Hill</h3>
<p>
What does economic development mean for you and Morgan Hill? </p><ul>
<li>More Jobs for Morgan Hill residents</li>
<li>Accessibility to shopping for needed goods and services</li>
<li>More revenue for public safety and city services</li>
<li>Employers who support civic activities</li>
</ul>
<p>Economic development and growth
control work together to create a city with predictable, steady
population increases and business development that creates a balanced
city that works. Our outstanding quality of life with its country
ambiance, natural beauty, numerous recreational opportunities and
attractive housing are promoted by Morgan Hill staff to attract new
employers and shopping to Morgan Hill as we also provide assistance to
our local businesses which are suffering from this economic downturn.
Our local businesses are the lifeblood of Morgan Hill and deserve to be
supported by our whole community. It&rsquo;s great to shop in
places where proprietors understand our needs and even know our names.
That&rsquo;s part of what makes Morgan Hill feel special. </p><p>
The Council needs to articulate its goal of fostering businesses
through a variety of efforts, including helpful development processing,
connecting businesses with prospective sites for entry and expansion,
and reaching out to businesses to help them overcome obstacles to
success. </p><p>
For example, if an auto dealer faces a shortage of trained technicians,
the City might make a connection to the Gavillan College automotive
technician program. The City might make space available in several of
its many facilities for weekly networking meetings. Fostering volunteer
efforts to assist in offsetting City service reductions in police,
parks and recreation not only improves services but also creates
another networking opportunity. These ideas are but a few of the many
that we can initiate and pursue in promoting Morgan Hill as a great
place to do business and live. </p>
<h4>My Economic Development Accomplishments</h4>
<ul>
<li>Helped to shepherd development
through the City&rsquo;s review process to allow businesses like
Safeway, Long&rsquo;s Drugs and Maple Leaf RV Park to be built,
thereby creating jobs and City revenue</li>
<li>Revised the City&rsquo;s sewer rate to make business fees more equitable</li>
<li>Participated in the Residential Development Control System review to maintain quality housing </li>
</ul>
